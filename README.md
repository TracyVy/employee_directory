# React App with Sort and Search Filter Functions

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

Given a data file (JSON), we can sort and search/filter data.

## Acceptance Criteria

The user should be able to:

- Sort the table by last names alphabetically, in asc or desc order.

- Search names with filter function.
